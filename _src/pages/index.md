# Get in touch!


Hi, we're always looking for people to join our group. You can contact us via [**Mattermost**](https://organise.earth/xrdeutschland/channels/comic_science), just say "hello" in our channel. In case you're wondering whether you'll fit in, here's a list of [roles we're looking to fill](https://share.nuclino.com/p/Open-Roles-uqyxIGnNvMnL_UZCewBh2Z) within our group. Most of us are currently based in Berlin where we meet in person once a week (you'll find the dates in our [MatterMost-channel](https://organise.earth/xrdeutschland/channels/comic_science) as well).
