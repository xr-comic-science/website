The last five years have been the warmest on record. And only two of the 20 warmest years on record since 1880 are not in this century: 1997 and 1998 [^NOAA1]. The Earth has warmed by 1°C on average compared to the pre‑industrial era [^ClimateCentral2018], but this warming is not evenly distributed. Europe has already warmed by at least 1.5°C and more if just summer is considered. The Earth is warming fast. The science behind this is clear and we've been aware of the details since the 1970s.

Put plainly, the Earth is warming due to the release of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere as a result of human activity — mostly from the combustion of fossil fuels like petrol and coal. Since 1850, all long-term warming trends can be explained by human activity — the causes are known[^Hausfather2017]!

This release of GHG (mainly CO~2~) is happening extremely quickly: currently at a rate ten times higher than the highest point of the past 65 million years[^Zeebe2016]. The Earth's resilience and adaptation are being pushed to their limits and probably beyond. And yet, rapid climatic changes aren't the only stressors that we humans are imposing on our Earth's systems. Deforestation, plastic pollution, over-fishing, chemical pollution, air pollution, over-exploitation, habitat destructions... the list goes on. A mass extinction event is underway[^Barnosky2011]! All help to destroy our environment and ecosystems and drive the Earth's life support toward collapse.

**There is no pretending otherwise: we are in the middle of a climate and ecological crisis.**
