# We are in an Emergency!

250 million years ago the Earth was pushed beyond its limit and 96% of all species were wiped from its surface. Scientists call this period the “Great Dying” and it took nearly 5 million years for the Earth to recover. This cataclysm was caused by a massive release of CO~2~ into the atmosphere, too much for the Earth to take [^Shen2011]. Are we on the verge of a new, human-made, “Great Dying”? If we don’t act fast then **yes we are** [^Rothman2019].

Once we cross a warming threshold or natural ecosystems collapse, Earth will start warming alone, all by itself, even after we stop emitting CO~2~. Like a giant boulder, once it goes downhill we won't be able to stop it. This is due to self-reinforcing loops [^Wolff2015]. For example, the massive amount of CO~2~ emitted by humans warms the atmosphere, triggering the melting of frozen Arctic ground, the permafrost, that releases long-trapped methane into the atmosphere, causing more warming and so on… Many feedback loops that reinforce Climate Change through various mechanisms exist: the dying of Amazon and boreal forests, the acidification of the oceans, destruction of marine ecosystems, slow down of the Atlantic major currents… These loops are already being triggered. For example, Arctic ground is melting at a rate that wasn’t expected to happen until at least the second half of the century [^Farqhuarson2019]! We urgently need to stop our own greenhouse gas emissions before crossing the hidden crucial limit where these loops spiral out of control. We don’t know exactly where that limit is, but scientists agree that if the climate warms by 1.5°C then we will enter a zone of uncertainties [^IPCC2018], where some mechanisms can start taking effect and push the Earth global warming further by themselves. Past 2°C warming some of these mechanisms will clearly be triggered and past 4°C global warming it will most likely be too late to avoid a "HotHouse" Earth scenario [^WorldBank2012][^Steffen2018] that will be irreversible for the next 10,000s of years and will almost certainly result in the complete collapse of our society. At our actual rate, we will have release the carbon necessary to reach 1.5°C by the end of 2027 [^MCCBerlin], and our rate is increasing!

This is why waiting to reduce our emissions is a gamble, on the survival of the human species. Immediate transformation is not a radical stance – it is the only sensible choice. Together we can stop the giant boulder from falling off the cliff while there is still time: **right now**.
