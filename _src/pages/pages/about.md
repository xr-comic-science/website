# What is Comic Science?

Comic Science is a group of scientists and designers trying to communicate the science behind the environmental and climate crisis and in an accessible and entertaining way.

We aspire to become a credible and trusted content powerhouse for the environmental movement.

# Our Scope

* Motivate people to take part in environmental civil disobedience actions
* Supporting the XR environmental movement with online and offline content including comics, illustration, written materials, and graphic designs.
* Raising awareness about the environmental and climate crisis

# Our Values

* We are part of the Extinction Rebellion (XR) movement, and share its [3 demands](https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/demands/) and [10 principles](https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/about-us/).
* We believe that being part of the climate movement must be fun and individually fulfilling, not a sacrifice or a chore.
* We believe in professionalism and large impact projects.
* We are communicators, not propagandists. Our materials are supported by sound scientific, philosophical, and historical research.
